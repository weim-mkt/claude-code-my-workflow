"""Make the qualification ledger load-bearing: what runs and what is recorded must agree.

The ledger's own rule is that a checker with no row is unqualified and its green
light means nothing. Until now nothing enforced that rule — the ledger could drift
from the repo in either direction and every gate stayed green.

Both directions fail here:

  1. a check that RUNS but has no ledger row — an unmeasured green light. A row in
     the "Not yet qualified" section counts as VISIBLE DEBT and only warns: the job
     is to prevent SILENT absence, not to force instant qualification.
  2. a ledger row naming a checker that is no longer on disk — a qualification for
     a ghost, which reads as coverage the repo does not have.

Plus wiring: a mistyped path in `.claude/settings.json` costs you the GUARDING,
and no other gate in the suite notices — nothing else reads the settings file
against the disk, so a hook can be wired to nothing while every check stays green.
That is the failure this checker exists to catch. The symptom is not silence, and
it is not legible either: `python3 <missing-path>` exits 2, which a PreToolUse hook
means as BLOCK, so a typo on a guard denies every matching call with an interpreter
error nobody reads as a config error; a bare path exits 127 (126 if present but not
executable), a non-blocking error that scrolls past while the guard stops guarding.

Registered checks are derived LIVE from three sources of truth — the `run` lines in
`scripts/backtest.sh`, the hook commands in `.claude/settings.json`, and the
`.githooks/pre-commit` entry point. Never a hardcoded list: a list here would drift
exactly the way the ledger does, and this checker would be the last to notice.

Exit: 0 agreement (warnings allowed), 1 disagreement, 2 could not run.

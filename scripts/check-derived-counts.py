    WHY THIS IS SCOPED, and not simply "scan CHANGELOG.md" the way every other
    row scans a whole file: the changelog keeps the `**Inventory at release: …**`
    line of EVERY past release. Those numbers were TRUE at their release and are
    a historical record — `.claude/references/audit-pet-peeves.md` #12
    ("historical CHANGELOG entries — do not update") is why CHANGELOG.md is not a
    check-surface-sync surface at all. Comparing them against today's disk would
    turn a CORRECT record red, and the only way to quiet that red would be to
    falsify or delete the history. So the view handed to the gate ends at the
    next `## ` heading: exactly ONE inventory line — the current release's — is
    ever compared, and v2.5.0's `36 rules, 7 hooks` (correct then, wrong now) is
    invisible to it.

    The window MOVES on its own. When the next release heading is added above,
    the line this gate checks becomes that release's, and the previous one
    becomes history — on the same commit, with no gate change and no exclusion
    list to maintain. And because these rows' surface is REQUIRED, deleting or
    rewording the current inventory line does not silently drop coverage: the
    row reports NO CLAIM MATCHED and the gate goes red.

    # assert a premise the count does not support: "a stub allows everything, so
    # exactly the expect_deny / expect_contains cases in that guard's sections
    # fail — count those call sites." False, and falsifiably so. A section letter
    # records which hook a case FIRES; a stub outcome turns on which hook
    # DECIDES, and those are two different partitions.
    # `root-of-trust-guard.py` imports `git-guardrails.py` and delegates the
    # destructive-verb deny list to it, so a set of section-(a) cases go red
    # under EITHER guard's stub. MEASURED at 727a66c, with an import-safe
    # always-allow stub of `git-guardrails.py` built exactly as the ledger's
    # reproduction note prescribes and run as
    #   HOOK_DIR=<copy> bash scripts/hook-battery.sh
    # the run reddened 81 cases — 8 in (a) + 24 in (b) + 49 in (c) — against the
    # 73 this function returns for "bc". So the gate did not merely miss the
    # right number, it DEFENDED the wrong one: planting the reproducible 81 in
    # the ledger made check-derived-counts FAIL.
    #
    # Widening the count was tried first and measured wrong inside the same
    # session, which is why the claim is narrowed instead. Widening needs a way
    # to IDENTIFY the routed cases, and the battery offers only prose — the
    # `CROSS-HOOK` marker some labels carry. That proxy was implemented and
    # returned 8; the r20 wave then added `a106`, a case the sibling decides
    # whose label says "cross-hook" in running prose and carries no marker, so
    # the marker-derived figure said 81 while the stub reddened 82. Which guard
    # DECIDES a case is a RUNTIME property. No static read of the battery text
    # recovers it, and a gate resting on an unenforced labelling convention
    # under-counts SILENTLY — precisely the failure this file exists to prevent.
    #
    # So the gate certifies what it can actually compute: the per-guard section
    # tally, which is also each guard row's N and the companion of its FPR

# --- Per-surface expectation --------------------------------------------------
#
# A row's `surfaces` entry is EITHER a bare path string — meaning this surface is
# REQUIRED to carry the claim, and a surface that stops matching is a gate
# failure — OR `OPT(path, why)`, meaning this surface is scanned but may
# legitimately make no such claim, with the reason written down.
#
# Why explicit expectation, and not inference: until 2026-08-23 `found` was ONE
# boolean per ROW, so the round-7 UNGATED failure fired only when EVERY surface
# in a row stopped matching. Reword the claim on one surface of a multi-surface
# row and the row stayed green on its sibling — the surface silently left
# coverage while the output still read like a pass ("hook battery cases
# CHANGELOG.md claims 51 actual 51 ok"). That is the r7 defect one dimension
# over. The obvious repair — "every declared surface must match" — is wrong on
# its own, because three declared surfaces legitimately carry no claim of their
# row's kind today (see the OPT reasons below); it would have made the gate red
# on a correct repo, and the fix for that noise would have been to DELETE those
# surfaces from the row, which is exactly how coverage disappears quietly.
#
# So the expectation is DECLARED, never guessed:
#   * a REQUIRED surface that matches nothing            -> UNGATED failure (red)
#   * an OPT surface that matches nothing                -> printed as
#     "no claim (optional: <why>)" — visible in the log, not silent
#   * an OPT surface that DOES match                     -> value-checked like
#     any other, so coverage can only grow by accident, never shrink
#   * a row with NO required surface at all              -> failure, because
#     such a row can never go red and is not a gate
# Demoting a REQUIRED surface to OPT therefore costs a diff with a written
# reason in it — a reviewable act — instead of an invisible non-match.
#
# 2026-08-23, one dimension further in: `found` moved from per-ROW to per-SURFACE
# and stopped there, so the SAME leak reappeared per INSTANCE. A surface that
# states its claim at several sites — LEDGER.md carries the battery count at
# eight, README.md carries the gate count at two — could have ONE instance
# reworded and stay green on its siblings, with the file then asserting two
# different numbers for one measurement. Proven, not assumed: rewriting the
# FIRST "(131 cases, exit 0)" in LEDGER.md to "(99 cases pass, exit 0)" left
# check-derived-counts, check-surface-sync, check-ledger-coverage and
# check-staleness all at exit 0. There is no way to detect an instance the
# pattern no longer matches, so the expectation is DECLARED like everything else
# here: REQ(path, n) says this surface carries the claim at EXACTLY n sites.
#
# EXACTLY, not "at least" — corrected 2026-08-24, and this is the second defect
# the same declaration produced. The rule shipped as "n AT LEAST: below n is a
# failure; above it is fine, so adding a site never goes red and losing one
# always does". The second clause was FALSE whenever the declared number fell
# behind the file, and it had: the row below declared six while LEDGER.md
# carried the claim at SEVEN (`grep -o '146 cases, exit 0' … | wc -l` -> 7),
# the only under-declared surface among the 31 in CHECKS. Measured on a copy of
# c285699 with all six count gates green: rewriting ONE of the seven out of
# coverage left check-derived-counts, check-surface-sync, check-staleness,
# check-ledger-coverage, check-skill-integrity and check-spec-conformance all at
# exit 0 — verified for each of the seven in turn — while rewriting TWO went
# red. So the machinery worked and the LITERAL had drifted, silently, because
# nothing checked it against the file it describes. A REQ surface carrying MORE
# sites than declared is now a FAILURE too: adding a site costs one number in
# this file, and in exchange the declared count can never again be quietly below
# reality. Disclosed residual: a BARE path still means "at least one", so a file
# that grows a second site and later loses it is still silent — promote such a
# surface to REQ (that is what REQ is for) rather than assuming the bare form

    # --- the current release's inventory line (r10) ---------------------------
    # CHANGELOG.md's `**Inventory at release: N skills, N agents, N rules,
    # N hooks, N gates**` publishes five counts of this repository's own
    # surfaces and NOT ONE of them was read by any gate: CHANGELOG.md is absent
    # from check-surface-sync's SURFACES (deliberately — see
    # changelog_current_release() for why), and no row here declared it for
    # skills/agents/rules/hooks/gates. A planted-lie sweep put 99 in each, one
    # at a time, and ./scripts/backtest.sh exited 0 every time.
    #
    # That is not hypothetical drift: on THIS branch alone the rules directory
    # went 36 -> 37, hooks 7 -> 8, and gates 8 -> 10 while the release notes were
    # being written. Once the heading below it is no longer the top one, the line
    # freezes as history — so a wrong number here becomes permanent.
    #
    # SCOPING: the surface is the CURRENT release section only, never the file.
    # Historical inventory lines (v2.5.0's `36 rules, 7 hooks`, v2.1.0's
    # `52 skills`) were correct at their release and must NOT be dragged to
    # today's values; they are outside the window and cannot go red. See
    # changelog_current_release().
    #
    # Anchored on "Inventory at release:" and confined to one line by `[^\n*]*?`,
    # which also stops at the closing `**` — so the trailing "(was 60 / 18 / 36 /
    # 7 / 8 at v2.5.0)" comparison, a deliberate historical statement about the
    # PREVIOUS release, is not matched either.

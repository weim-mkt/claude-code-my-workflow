# hook-battery.sh — prove the ACTIVE guard hooks still fire.
#
# A hook is the one gate nobody watches. It runs in a subprocess, its output is
# a decision the harness consumes, and when it stops working it stops working
# SILENTLY: no error, no red gate, just a session that behaves as though the
# hook had nothing to say. `check-ledger-coverage.py` proves each hook is WIRED
# to a file that exists. This battery proves the file still DOES something —
# it re-seeds each guard's target failure on every run and checks that the
# guard goes red on it, and stays quiet on a clean control.
#
# Covered (the three guards that make a DECISION; the passive convenience hooks
# are listed as visible debt in quality_reports/qualification/LEDGER.md):
#
#   root-of-trust-guard.py   shell write into the repo's root of trust
#   git-guardrails.py        destructive git + the clean-tree precondition
#   claim-reconcile.py       numeric claims that a just-edited file can stale
#
# Every fixture is built under a mktemp directory that is removed on exit; the
# real .claude/ tree is never written to, and the throwaway git repository is
# created inside the temp directory, never the repo under test.
#
# ISOLATION IS NOT `git -C`. This battery runs inside `.githooks/pre-commit`,
# and git EXPORTS its repository into a hook's environment: GIT_DIR,
# GIT_INDEX_FILE, GIT_WORK_TREE, GIT_COMMON_DIR, GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY,
# GIT_PREFIX, GIT_NAMESPACE and siblings. GIT_DIR overrides repository
# DISCOVERY; `-C` only changes the working directory. From a LINKED WORKTREE
# those variables are ABSOLUTE, so the fixture's `init`/`add`/`commit` operated
# on the USER'S repository — writing a junk `seed` commit onto their branch,
# leaving a phantom deletion in their tree, and aborting the commit that
# triggered the hook. (Found by /blast-radius, 2026-08-23; reproduced end to
# end from a linked worktree of a fresh clone.) The whole GIT_* namespace is
# therefore stripped below before any fixture is built, and cases e1-e3 pin it.
#
# HOOK_DIR overrides which hook directory is exercised. That is how the battery
# itself is qualified: point it at a stub guard that always allows and it must
# go red, because a battery that cannot fail is decoration.
#
# Exit 0 = every case passed. Exit 1 = at least one case failed (named on
# stdout). Exit 2 = the battery could not run, which is a failure, not a pass.

# continued `cp`/`mv`/redirection into `settings.json` were silent too, while

#         first, so only an odd trailing backslash joins.

# a31-a42 (r14): THE CROSS-HOOK PATH — this is why a git op appears in the
# ROOT-OF-TRUST section, which otherwise has nothing to say about git history.
# Two guards split the work between them, and each was correct about its own
# half: root-of-trust-guard.py UNWRAPS command payloads (`bash -c '...'`,
# `env -S '...'`) and judges PATH writes; git-guardrails.py judges DESTRUCTIVE
# GIT but treats a `-c` payload as opaque and does not unwrap it. A payload
# carrying a destructive git verb and NO protected path therefore fell BETWEEN
# them: this hook unwrapped it, found no protected path, and returned 0; the
# sibling never saw the verb at all. `bash -c 'git reset --hard'` and
# `bash -c 'git clean -fdx'` RAN — the second removing untracked and ignored
# files, which is research data no reflog holds. A shell wrapper is how a
# script, a Makefile, or a generated command line ordinarily spells things, so
# "a determined caller was never the threat model" did not excuse it.
# (Found by the EXTERNAL REFEREE — GPT-5.6 Sol Pro, 2026-08-23 oracle pass,
# finding 5; a31 and a32 are the referee's own two named cases.)
#
# The fix ROUTES: every payload this hook is willing to unwrap is now passed to
# git-guardrails' `git_deny_reason()`, IMPORTED rather than copied, so there is
# one definition of "destructive git" and the two hooks cannot drift apart.
# These cases therefore pin the ROUTING, not the deny list — the reason text
# they emit is the sibling's own. a33 uses a THIRD deny-list rule for exactly
# that reason: it proves the whole shared list is reachable, not two special
# cases welded in.

# a43-a53 (r15): SHELL GLOBS AND BRACE GROUPS. `matches_root_of_trust` compared

# out of the guard's sight while the shell expanded it to exactly the protected

# verdict, then what the shell expands the token to:
#     rm -f .claude/hook?/git-guardrails.py   ALLOW -> .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py
#     rm -f .claude/*/git-guardrails.py       ALLOW -> .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py

# while the literal spellings of all three targets DENIED — a one-character
# edit flipped every denied spelling to allowed. Globbing was on NEITHER
# disclosed-residual list, and unlike everything that IS on them it failed
# toward ALLOW.
#
# a45 and a49 are not repetition: they put the metacharacter inside the
# protected DIRECTORY name, which also defeated the LITERAL `.claude`/
# `.githooks` fast path in main() — a second copy of the same defect one level
# up, and one that stayed silent after the pattern half was fixed. Measured.
#
# The four controls are what stop this from being "deny anything with a `*`":
#   a50 — a glob under `.claude/` that names an UNPROTECTED child (`rule?`)
#   a51 — a BARE wildcard elsewhere (`rm -f docs/*`). This is the sharp one: a
#         bare `*` fnmatches every protected name, so the naive fix denies the
#         most ordinary command in the repo. It must stay silent, and it can,
#         because bash without `dotglob` never expands `*` to a DOTFILE.
#   a52 — a READ through a glob stays allowed ("every READ is untouched")
#   a53 — SCOPE: the same glob aimed at a clone OUTSIDE the project stays
#         allowed, so the r11 scoping still holds through the glob path

# a77-a91 (r19): TWO SPELLINGS OF A PROTECTED PATH THE GUARD COULD NOT SEE.
#
# (1) ANSI-C QUOTING AND LOCALE TRANSLATION. `unquote()` knew `'…'`, `"…"` and
# backslash escapes and nothing else. Bash has two more quote openers and both
# put a `$` immediately in front of the quote — `$'…'` (ANSI-C, escapes
# decoded) and `$"…"` (locale translation). The `$` survived into the unquoted
# word, so `$'.claude/settings.json'` became `$.claude/settings.json`, which
# matches no protected segment. Measured 2026-08-24 against the shipped guard,
# event cwd = the project:
#
#     echo X > .claude/settings.json             DENY   (control)
#     echo X > $'.claude/settings.json'          ALLOW (silent)
#     echo X > $".claude/settings.json"          ALLOW (silent)
#     rm -f $'.claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py'   ALLOW (silent)
#
# a80 is the sharper one: `$'\x2eclaude/…'` carries NONE of the literal
# characters of `.claude`, so it also had to get past `_may_name_a_protected_
# path`, the literal substring fast path that stands in front of the whole scan
# — the r15 defect one level up, and the same shape as it. What bash really
# decodes these to was measured with `printf '%s'` on bash 5.3.9, not assumed:
# `$'\x2eclaude/hooks/x'` -> `.claude/hooks/x`.
#
# (2) CASE. This repository lives on APFS, which is case-INSENSITIVE by default,
# so `.CLAUDE/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.json` are ONE file and `RM`
# really runs rm (`command -v RM` resolves). The segment comparison, the
# writer-program basename lookups and the fast path were all case-sensitive:
#
#     echo X > .CLAUDE/settings.json             ALLOW (silent)
#     RM -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py      ALLOW (silent)
#
# while both lowercase twins DENIED. The fold is UNCONDITIONAL — no filesystem
# probe — by the same ruling the r15 glob fix made, so its cost is a false DENY
# on a case-SENSITIVE filesystem for a directory literally spelled `.CLAUDE`
# that is not the root of trust.
#
# THE CONTROLS ARE WHAT MAKE THE NEW RECALL MEAN ANYTHING, and each is aimed at
# a specific way the fix could have been over-broad:
#   a81/a90 — every READ is still allowed, through BOTH new spellings.
#   a82/a91 — the r11 project SCOPE survives both: the same spelling aimed at a
#             tree outside the project stays silent.
#   a83     — a `$'…'` that is genuinely just TEXT does not become a deny.
#   a88/a89 — an ordinary unprotected path is untouched, lowercase and upper.
# The literal-twin denies these are measured against are a25 (redirection) and
# a5/a20 (deleters), which stay green unchanged.

# a92-a102 — r20, THE THIRD DEFECT FROM THE SAME FAST PATH: ORDINARY QUOTING
# PLACED INSIDE THE PROTECTED DIRECTORY NAME. `_may_name_a_protected_path` is a
# case-folded LITERAL substring test standing in front of the entire scan, and a
# quote or a backslash sprinkled through `.claude`/`.githooks` carries neither
# literal, no glob metacharacter and no `$` opener — so the line was rejected
# there and the scan, which unquotes every word at every nesting depth and would
# have denied all of these, never ran. Measured 2026-08-24 at 727a66c, event cwd
# = the project, guard verdict then what bash actually does:
#
#     rm -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py     DENY   (literal control)
#     rm -f .clau\de/hooks/git-guardrails.py    ALLOW (silent) -> file DELETED
#     echo X > .clau\de/settings.json           ALLOW (silent)
#     rm -f .githook\s/pre-commit               ALLOW (silent)
#     rm -f .cl'aud'e/hooks/git-guardrails.py   ALLOW (silent) -> file DELETED
#     rm -f .cl"aud"e/hooks/git-guardrails.py   ALLOW (silent)
#
# THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS ONE TEST HAS PRODUCED A FALSE ALLOW (r15 globs,
# r19 case and `$'…'`), so the repair is the CLASS and not three more spellings:
# the trigger is now also computed on a copy of the line with `\`, `'` and `"`
# DELETED. Those three are the complete set of characters that can sit inside a
# word without changing which file the word names — every other quoting form
# bash has is one of them with a `$` in front, which r19 already tests for — so
# deletion collapses every arrangement of them, at any depth, back to the
# literal the shell will use. a97 is the depth case; there is no fourth
# character to enumerate later.
#
# THE CONTROLS ARE WHAT KEEP THE WIDENING HONEST. a98/a99 pin that the same
# quoting in an UNPROTECTED path is untouched; a100 that every READ is still
# allowed through the new spelling; a101 that the r11 project scoping still
# holds (the same spelling aimed at a clone outside the project stays silent);
# and a102 is the sharp one — a target whose denoised form LOOKS protected while
# bash resolves it to a different file entirely, proving the denoise is a
# TRIGGER and not a verdict. What bash really does with both spellings was
# measured with printf on bash 5.3.9, not assumed: `.clau\de/hooks/x` ->
# `.claude/hooks/x` (the guard file), `$'.clau\de/hooks/x'` -> `.clau\de/hooks/x`
# (an unrecognised ANSI-C escape keeps BOTH characters, so this is a different
# name). a83 already pins the plain-text `$'…'` control and stays green.

# `SystemExit` is not an `Exception`. So a `sys.exit()` reached while the

# 0 and an EMPTY stdout — and empty stdout is exactly what an ALLOW looks like,
# with no way to tell the two apart from outside. Measured 2026-08-24 at

# gate-file write, caused by the loader for a rule that had not even run yet.
# Not hypothetical: an audit agent hit it by accident while building a stub and
# read the spurious result as a finding.
#
# Each case runs a COPY of the guard out of a directory built beside a stub
# sibling, because the sibling is located from the guard file's own directory.
# a104 is the behaviour that must NOT regress — an ordinary Exception at the

# a110-a112 — r20, THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE QUOTING CLASS, found by probing the
# a92-a102 repair instead of being reported: a LINE CONTINUATION inside the
# protected directory name. Two things had to be wrong at once for it to reach a
# false ALLOW, and only the second is about the fast path:
#
#   * `join_continuations` substituted a SPACE for the backslash-newline. POSIX
#     says the pair is REMOVED ("the <backslash> and <newline> shall be removed
#     before splitting the input into tokens"), and the difference is invisible
#     at a token BOUNDARY — which is where r11's own measured case sat — and
#     decisive INSIDE a word: the splice split one word bash keeps whole.
#   * the fast path then never saw `.claude` in either the raw line or the
#     denoised one, because deleting the backslash still leaves the newline.
#
# Measured 2026-08-24 at 727a66c, event cwd = the project: `rm -f .clau\` +
# newline + `de/hooks/git-guardrails.py` was ALLOWED (silent) while the literal
# twin DENIED, and `printf '%s\n'` on the same string prints ONE word,
# `.claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py`. a111 is the r11 spelling this splicer was
# written for and must keep working; a112 is the control that a naive
# "delete the backslash-newline and glue everything" repair fails — a
# continuation followed by INDENTATION is still two words to bash, and
# `.clau` + `   de/hooks/…` names nothing protected.

# b24-b33 (r19): THE r10 QUOTING HOLE HAD TWO SPELLINGS LEFT, AND A THIRD
# DIMENSION NOBODY HAD LOOKED AT.
#
# r10 ported this deny list off raw-string regexes onto tokens precisely so that
# quoting one word could not defeat it. It closed `"…"` and `'…'`. Bash has two
# more openers — `$'…'` (ANSI-C) and `$"…"` (locale translation) — and the `$`
# in front of the quote was falling through `_unquote` into the word, so
# `$'--hard'` became `$--hard` and the whole-word comparison missed. Separately,
# the command word itself was compared with `== "git"` while this filesystem is
# case-insensitive (`command -v GIT` resolves to /usr/bin/GIT). Measured
# 2026-08-24 against the shipped hook on a fixture repository:
#
#     git reset --hard HEAD        DENY   (control)
#     git reset $'--hard' HEAD     ALLOW (silent)
#     git $'merge' other           ALLOW (silent)
#     git clean $'-fd'             ALLOW (silent)
#     git reset $"--hard" HEAD     ALLOW (silent)
#     GIT reset --hard HEAD        ALLOW (silent)
#     Git merge other              ALLOW (silent)
#
# b27 is the one that needs the DECODER rather than just the opener: bash
# expands `$'\x2dA'` to `-A`, so a guard that stripped the quotes but left the
# escape would still compare `\x2dA` against `-A` and miss. What bash really
# produces was measured with `printf '%s'` on bash 5.3.9.
#
# The SUBCOMMAND is deliberately not folded, and b32 is why that costs nothing:
# git itself refuses a case-varied subcommand (`git STATUS` exits 128, "cannot
# handle STATUS as a builtin", measured on git 2.50.1), so folding it would add
# only false denies. The controls b30-b33 pin the other direction — the fix
# recognises two more openers and one more spelling of the program name, it does
# not deny every command carrying a `$'` or every word beginning with GIT.

# ── r8, AS AMENDED AT r13: the rule this block pins ────────────────────────
# The clean-tree check STOPPED SIMULATING THE SHELL at r8, and r13 corrected two
# things r8 got wrong. What it pins NOW, rule by rule:
#   (0) an identified history op must be a STANDALONE SIMPLE COMMAND, or it is
#       DENIED without reading the tree (r13). The reading is taken at
#       PreToolUse, so a chain, pipeline, redirection, substitution, `cd` or
#       assignment could act between the reading and git.
#   (1) no history op as an actual command → silent.
#   (2) an ESCAPE op (`--abort`/`--continue`/`--skip`/`--quit`/`--edit-todo`)
#       → ALLOW without reading the tree. `--autostash` was in this list until
#       r13 and is NOT any more: it reads the tree and is allowed only when
#       there is no `??` entry, because git's autostash does not stash
#       untracked files (c9 flipped to DENY; c42 is its control).
#   (3) otherwise read `git status --porcelain` LIVE in the directory the
#       invocation itself names and DENY if it is non-empty. An UNRESOLVED
#       repository selector denies too, rather than falling back (r13).
# r8's own heading called this "a closed whole-command allowlist". It was not —
# an unidentified invocation (`bash -c '...'`) passes outside the rule entirely.
# Corrected wording lives in the guard's docstring; see the r13 block below.
#
# DELETED IN r8, because each of these tested ONLY the simulator that is gone:
#   old c7  `git stash push && git pull` ALLOW   — the stash-effect "clean" verdict
#   old c8  push && pop && merge DENY            — the redirty state machine
#   old c9  `-m pop` message-not-subcommand ALLOW— the stash subcommand parser
#   old c10 pathspec-limited push DENY           — the "partial" classification
#   old c11 `--keep-index` DENY                  — the stash FLAG allowlist
#   old c12 bare `-p` DENY                       — the stash FLAG allowlist
#   old c13 invented stash flag DENY             — the stash FLAG allowlist
#   old c14 `stash branch` DENY                  — the stash SUBCOMMAND allowlist
#   old c15 invented stash subcommand DENY       — the stash SUBCOMMAND allowlist
#   old c20 `git log > f` between DENY           — the inert-segment allowlist
#   old c21 `echo >> f` between DENY             — the inert-segment allowlist
#   old c22 inert `echo` preserves the mark ALLOW— the inert-segment allowlist
# Every one of them now resolves to the same trivial answer ("the tree is dirty,
# so DENY") and none of them can distinguish a working guard from a broken one.
# Old c4/c7/c9/c22 flipped ALLOW→DENY: that flip is the ACCEPTED COST, and c4
# below pins it so nobody "fixes" it back.
# Retained from earlier rounds: old c1→c1, c2→c2, c3→c3, c4→c4 (flipped),

# ── r9: the parse holes that survived r8's deletion of the simulator ────────
# r8 removed every PREDICTION about what the shell would do, and that held —
# round 9 found no way to make a dirty tree read as clean. What it found
# instead is that the small amount of PARSING still required (which segment is
# a git invocation, which words are git's globals, whether the op is exempt)
# had holes, and each one skipped the tree reading entirely.
#
#   c18 — rule 2 was a SUBSTRING search over the joined, already-unquoted
#         segment, so an exempt token appearing inside an option VALUE switched
#         the whole check off. Executed on a dirty fixture, `git merge -m "wip
#         --autostash later" feature` was ALLOWED. The exemption is now exact
#         TOKEN equality with value-taking options' values skipped.
#   c19 — the control for that fix: a REAL `--autostash` must still be exempt
#         even when a -m value also names an exempt flag, so recall was not
#         bought with a false deny.
#   c20 — a segment was tested for git by its FIRST WORD only, so any shell
#         compound keyword in front of the op hid it. `if true; then git merge
#         x; fi` was SILENT while bare `git merge x` DENIED, and the merge ran
#         over uncommitted work in the fixture.
#   c21 — the grouping form of the same hole, attached-paren spelling.
#   c22 — the loop form, plus an UNRESOLVABLE `-C $d`: an unreadable named
#         directory used to be treated as clean and ALLOWED; it now degrades to
#         reading the event cwd.
#   c23 — the clean-tree half of the b3/b4 global-option hole.
#   c24 — the r8-DISCLOSED bare command wrapper, now closed: a `git` word is
#         searched for ALONG the segment, not only at its head.
#   c25 — a RELATIVE `-C` was resolved against the HOOK PROCESS's cwd instead
#         of the event's, so `git -C . pull` in a dirty repo A was judged
#         against whatever repo B the hook sat in. Fired deliberately from the
#         OTHER checkout so the two directories differ.
#   c26 — a trailing shell COMMENT put an exempt token on the invocation.

# c28 is the one that cannot be satisfied by over-denying.

# ── (c) continued — r13: ENFORCEMENT AT EXECUTION TIME, NOT AT HOOK TIME ----
# An independent frontier-model referee (2026-08-23) found the defect eleven
# in-house rounds missed, because every one of them tested chains in ONE
# direction. This hook decides at PreToolUse -- BEFORE bash runs the command --
# so the referee's case, on a CLEAN repository:
#
#     printf '\n# local work\n' >> analysis.R && git merge main
#
# reads clean at hook time and is dirty when git executes. Rounds 4-12 DENIED the
# chain that CLEANED the tree (c4) and ALLOWED the chain that DIRTIED it: the
# whole false-deny cost, none of the safety, while the docstring's summary and
# law 20 both claimed the stronger guarantee. A history op is therefore accepted
# only as a STANDALONE SIMPLE COMMAND (rule 0) -- a genuinely closed grammar over
# the text the parser sees, rather than a best-effort search for cleaners.
#
# These cases run on the CLEAN fixtures on purpose. On a dirty tree every one of
# them would deny for the ordinary reason and the block could not discriminate at
# all; on a clean tree, a deny can ONLY come from the rule under test. c32, c36,
# c39 and c42 are the controls, and they are what stops rule 0 from being
# satisfied by a guard that denies everything.

# ── (c) continued — r15: THE READING ITSELF WAS THE HOLE ───────────────────
# r13 fixed WHEN the tree is read and WHICH repository is named. r15 is about
# the reading: the question git was asked could be reconfigured, the directory
# it was asked about could be mis-composed, and a question that came back
# UNANSWERED was scored as a pass.
#
#   c43-c46 — `git status --porcelain` HONOURS CONFIGURATION. With
#     `status.showUntrackedFiles=no` (the documented remedy for a slow status
#     on a large worktree) porcelain reports NO `??` lines at all: measured on
#     git 2.50.1, a repo holding one untracked file answers '' to the guard's
#     query and '?? note.txt' to `--untracked-files=normal`. The guard read ''
#     and ALLOWED both a plain merge and an `--autostash` one — reproducing
#     the exact hole r13 narrowed `--autostash` to close, since untracked
#     files are the whole reason that narrowing exists, and satisfying both
#     directions of the c9/c42 control because neither sets the config.
#     c46 is the same class found by auditing the call rather than by a
#     referee: `diff.ignoreSubmodules=all` hides a submodule holding modified
#     work from porcelain (measured: ' M sub' by default, '' with the setting,
#     ' M sub' again with `--ignore-submodules=none`). Both flags are now part
#     of the query, so the repository being guarded cannot reconfigure the
#     reading. c45 is the control: the SAME config on a genuinely clean repo
#     must stay silent, which over-denying cannot satisfy.
#
#   c47-c50 — MULTIPLE `-C` COMPOSE. git(1): "If multiple -C options are
#     given, each subsequent non-absolute -C <path> is interpreted relative to
#     the preceding -C <path>." The guard kept only the LAST one and resolved
#     it against the EVENT cwd, so a trailing relative `-C` discarded a
#     leading absolute one and the guard read a DIFFERENT repository from the
#     one git operates in. Measured: from a clean checkout, real git resolves
#     `-C <dirty> -C .` to <dirty> and the guard ALLOWED the merge. c48 and
#     c50 are the controls that over-denying cannot satisfy — denying every
#     multi-`-C` invocation would pass c47/c49 and fail both.
#
#   c51-c53 — AN UNREADABLE STATUS IS NOT AN ALLOW. `read_status` returned the
#     same None for a timeout, a non-zero exit and "not a repository", and the
#     caller with no `-C` read that as "not a repository → git's problem" and
#     CONTINUED. So a `git status` that merely ran slowly (a large worktree, a
#     cold cache, a network filesystem — and note that the r15 config defect
#     above is the documented remedy for exactly that slowness) was a silent
#     ALLOW on a dirty tree, one line below the `-C` branch that r13 fixed for
#     being the same mistake. c51/c52 shim a `git` on PATH that cannot answer;
#     c53 is the control that keeps the one BENIGN cause allowed.

# ── (c) continued — r18: THE `-C` FOLD WAS LEXICAL, GIT'S IS THE KERNEL'S ──
# c47-c50 fixed WHICH `-C` wins. r18 is about how each one is RESOLVED. The fold
# went through `os.path.normpath`, which pops a `..` off the path as WRITTEN;
# git folds `-C` by `chdir()`, and the kernel pops a `..` off the path RESOLVED
# — the physical parent of a symlink's TARGET, not of the link. The two diverge
# the instant a `..` follows a symlinked component, and the guard's own
# docstring claimed it read "the directory git will chdir into".
#
# Measured at e0c4cdb on the fixtures below: `git -C link/.. rev-parse
# --show-toplevel` fired from the CLEAN repo prints the DIRTY one, while
# `normpath` prints the clean one. The guard read the clean tree, said nothing,
# and real bash then fast-forwarded the dirty repository — 'Updating
# b558893..4fe1bdd / Fast-forward', its HEAD advanced, its ' M sub/f.txt' still
# sitting there on top of merged history. That is the exact outcome the
# clean-tree rule exists to refuse, reached with no `cd` (rule 0 denies those),
# no chain, and no unresolvable selector: it resolves — to the wrong repository.
# The byte-equivalent `-C <dirty absolute>` DENIED, so the verdict turned on
# whether the path was spelled through the symlink.
#
# c62-c64 are the controls, and c63 is the sharp one: a `..` that follows a
# symlink but LANDS IN THE CLEAN REPOSITORY must stay allowed, because that is
# where git will actually operate. A "deny whenever `..` follows a symlink"
# repair passes c57-c61 and fails c63; the kernel-faithful fold passes both.
#
# CORRECTED AT r19: c60 (the ATTACHED `-Clink/..`) was recorded here as one of
# the spellings that reached the r18 false ALLOW. It cannot have been — git
# rejects an attached `-C<path>` outright (`git -C.` exits 129 on 2.50.1, while
# `git -C .` exits 0), so that spelling never runs at all. It is relabelled
# below as a DEFENSIVE CONTROL and is no longer counted as a reproduction; the
# demonstrated r18 class is the FOUR separated spellings c57-c59 and c61.

# so the two halves of one guard could not disagree about what a command says.
# Both r19 spellings therefore have to be pinned on THIS side too, or the fix is
# only known to hold on the half that was measured. Against the shipped hook on
# a dirty fixture, `git $'merge' other` and `Git merge other` were both ALLOWED

# ── (e) the battery's own isolation from git's hook environment ────────────
# This battery runs INSIDE .githooks/pre-commit. Everything above is worthless
# if the battery's own fixtures escape into the repository the hook was fired
# from — and for one release they did: `git -C <fixture>` does not isolate
# against an exported GIT_DIR, so from a linked worktree the fixture's
# init/add/commit wrote a junk `seed` commit onto the USER'S branch, left a
# phantom deletion in their tree, and aborted their commit on every retry.
#
# The check re-enters this script with git's hook environment exported at a
# DECOY repository — the same two variables git really exports, absolute, as
# they arrive from a linked worktree — and then asks the decoy three questions.
#
# The three verdicts are computed here and handed to `expect_contains` through
# `verdict`, rather than calling ok/no directly, because the derived-counts
# gate counts `expect_` CALL SITES as the case count and the battery prints
# PASS+FAIL: a case that skips the helpers makes those two numbers disagree,
# which is the drift that gate exists to stop. Exactly three calls are made on
# every path, including the one where the decoy repo cannot be built.

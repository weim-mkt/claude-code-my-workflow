# backtest.sh — prove the whole repo is internally consistent and currently true.
#
# Run this after ANY change. It is the difference between a maintained repo and
# one that merely looks maintained. Ten gates:
#
#   1. surface-sync        counts + enumerative tables match what is on disk
#   2. skill-integrity     frontmatter <-> body tool parity, anchors, flag parity
#   3. model-versions      no superseded model presented as current (internal
#                         consistency against the model SSoT; the EXPIRY on that
#                         SSoT is enforced by gate 6, staleness)
#   4. links               every relative link and heading anchor resolves
#   5. spec-conformance    every skill obeys the Agent Skills spec
#   6. staleness           stale recommendations, source/render divergence, expired currency
#   7. repo-hygiene       no scratch-as-main, no root clutter, archives documented
#   8. derived-counts     enumerable claims (journals, patterns, phases, snippets)
#                         verified against their own source of truth
#   9. ledger-coverage    the qualification ledger and the checks that actually run
#                         agree in BOTH directions, and every hook in settings.json
#                         is wired to a file that exists (a mistyped path there
#                         disables a hook in silence)
#  10. hook-battery       the active guard hooks are driven with synthetic events
#                         and must still go red on the failure each one targets —
#                         gate 9 proves a hook is wired, this proves it still acts
#   +  findings-validator  smoke test, so a review run cannot fail at the last step
#
# Every gate runs to completion even if an earlier one fails — you get the whole
# picture in one pass. Exit code is the max of all gates.
#
# No `set -e`: it would abort after the first failure and hide the rest.

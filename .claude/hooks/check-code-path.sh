# Drift guard for the scripts/{R,stata,python}/ -> code/ migration (this fork's convention).
#
# This fork keeps all analysis code under code/ (R at code/, Stata at
# code/stata/, Python at code/python/). Upstream uses scripts/R/,
# scripts/stata/, scripts/python/. When upstream merges land, they may
# reintroduce those paths. This script greps for any remaining live
# references (excluding archival files that legitimately mention historical
# paths) and reports them so the user can fix the drift before it propagates.
#
# Wired in two places:
#   1. .claude/settings.json -> SessionStart hook (Claude-side coverage)
#   2. .githooks/post-merge   (terminal-side coverage; needs core.hooksPath)
#
# Exits 0 unconditionally so it never blocks a session start. Drift is
# reported via stdout/stderr to surface the warning without halting work.

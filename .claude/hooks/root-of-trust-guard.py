Silent-Shell-Write Tripwire for the gate-defining files (PreToolUse, Bash only)

NAMING, STATED UP FRONT. The file is called `root-of-trust-guard.py` and the
path set below is referred to as the "gate-defining files". It is NOT a root of
trust and this hook is NOT a guard in the sense that word usually carries. An
independent referee (2026-08-23) was right about this: a repo-local, mutable,
fail-open textual scan cannot be the thing everything else stands on. What it
actually is:

    a best-effort TRIPWIRE against SILENT shell writes into the files that
    decide whether any other gate runs.

Its whole value is a change of CHANNEL, not a prohibition: a modification to a
gate arrives as a reviewable Edit/Write diff instead of an invisible one-line
overwrite. It does not lock the files, and it cannot.

WHAT CAN REPLACE OR DISABLE IT ANYWAY — all four are ordinary, allowed, and
none of them trips this hook:

    1. an Edit / Write / MultiEdit on these same files (deliberately allowed —
       see below). That includes an edit removing this hook's registration
       from `.claude/settings.json`. The diff is visible AFTERWARDS; under
       `bypassPermissions` nothing authorises it BEFOREHAND.
    2. an ordinary branch transition — `git switch <branch>` / `git checkout
       <branch>` with no pathspec — onto a branch whose tree deletes
       `.claude/hooks/` or carries an older `.claude/settings.json`. There is
       no protected literal path on that command line to test.
    3. a clean merge or pull that imports changes to these files, for the same
       reason.
    4. an error in THIS file. It fails open (see "Decision protocol"), so an
       allowed edit that introduces a syntax error here silently converts the
       tripwire into a no-op.

So read every sentence below as "raises the cost of one silent path", never as
"cannot be disabled".

The template ships `permissions.defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` with an
empty `deny` list, so the hook layer is the only thing watching the files that
decide whether any other gate runs at all:

    .claude/settings.json        — which hooks fire, and on what
    .claude/settings.local.json  — the same, per machine
    .claude/hooks/               — the gates themselves
    .githooks/                   — the pre-commit gate suite
    .claude/                     — the directory, because deleting it
                                   deletes the hooks

This hook denies SHELL writes into those paths — the silent path, where one
redirection disables the whole suite and nothing surfaces in review until much
later.

SCOPE — THIS PROJECT, not every tree on the machine. A path is protected
only when it matches the pattern above AND resolves inside the project
directory (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, else the git repository the call runs in,
else the repository this file ships in). A fixture clone under /tmp, a
second checkout, and the user's own `~/.claude/settings.json` are other
trees: denying writes there protected none of the gates this repo runs,
while it DID block the qualification ledger's own gate-9 reproduction,
which seeds a mistyped hook path into a fixture clone's settings file. The
deny message names the project directory it is speaking for, so the claim
"this repository's gate-defining files" is checkable rather than asserted. If
no project directory can be resolved at all, the guard falls back to the plain
text match and says so in the message.

Denied, when the target is a protected path:

    - redirection            `> f`, `>> f`, `&> f`, `&>> f`, `>| f`, `>& f` —
                             `&>>` is bash's APPEND-both form and `>&` its
                             csh-style redirect-both, identical in effect to
                             `&> f` whenever f is not a file descriptor. Both
                             are carried by `_TOKEN` and by the `_REDIR`
                             backstop; this list omitted `&>>` until r19, so it
                             under-reported what the regexes already caught.
                             FILE-DESCRIPTOR DUPLICATION is NOT a write and
                             stays allowed: `>&2`, `1>&2`, `2>&1`, `>&-` name a
                             descriptor, not a path
    - tee                    `... | tee f`
    - copy / link            cp, install, rsync, scp, ln (DESTINATION only —
                             copying a hook out is a read)
    - move / delete          mv, rm, unlink, shred (ANY argument — moving a
                             hook away disables it as surely as deleting it)
    - in-place edit          sed -i, perl -i, truncate, dd of=
    - git working-tree write `git rm`, `git checkout [<rev>] -- <path>`,
                             `git restore <path>`, `git clean -f <path>`,
                             `git stash push -- <path>`, `git mv` — git is a
                             writer program too, and these modify or delete the
                             gate-defining files exactly as rm/cp/mv do, with the
                             protected path as a literal argument. Read-only git
                             (status, log, diff, show, ls-files, rev-parse) is
                             untouched; a protected `-C <dir>` counts only when
                             the subcommand is one of the writers above
    - find deleter           find <protected> ... -delete / -exec rm|mv|... —
                             a plain shell deleter of the same class as rm
    - tar extraction         tar -x ... -C <protected> — extraction WRITES
                             files into the destination directory
    - shell wrapper          sh/bash/zsh/dash/ksh -c '<payload>' — the -c
                             payload is UNWRAPPED and re-scanned (depth <= 2),
                             so a redirection or deleter hidden inside it is
                             caught rather than swallowed by the tokenizer. The
                             shell's OWN options are parsed (long options never
                             count as `-c`; `--rcfile`/`--init-file`/`-o` are
                             consumed WITH their values), so a value-taking
                             option cannot make the guard read the wrong word as
                             the payload and skip the real one
    - command wrapper        env / sudo / doas / nice / stdbuf / ionice /
                             timeout / nohup / time / command / exec — the
                             wrapper AND its option arguments (`env -i`,
                             `env -u FOO`, `nice -n 10`, `sudo -u root`,
                             `stdbuf -oL`, `ionice -c2`, `timeout 5`) are
                             consumed so the REAL command behind them — a shell
                             `-c` OR a bare deleter (`nice rm .claude/...`) — is
                             reached and the -c-unwrap / deny logic applies to it
    - env split-string       env -S '<payload>' / env --split-string='<payload>'
                             (the attached `-S<payload>`/`--split-string=` forms,
                             AND the bundled short-flag forms `env -vS`/`env -iS`)
                             make env SPLIT the string into words and EXECUTE
                             them, so it is a command-payload carrier exactly like
                             a shell `-c`. env is located through the SAME
                             wrapper-skip as everything else, so `nice env -S …`
                             / `timeout 5 env -S …` reach it; the payload is then
                             UNWRAPPED and re-scanned (depth <= 2), not skipped as
                             an opaque value

Denied REGARDLESS of any protected path — the cross-hook rule:

    - destructive git inside an UNWRAPPED PAYLOAD. `bash -c 'git reset --hard'`
      and `bash -c 'git clean -fdx'` used to fall between the two hooks and be
      denied by neither: this hook's rules all key off a protected LITERAL path
      and there is none, while `git-guardrails.py` treats a shell-wrapper
      payload as one opaque word. Ordinary execution forms, not evasions. So
      the payload this hook already unwraps for its own path rules (shell `-c`,
      `env -S`, behind the usual wrappers, depth <= 2) is ALSO handed to
      `git-guardrails.py`'s own `git_deny_reason()` — the SHARED destructive-git
      deny list (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `push --force`, `add -A`,
      `checkout -- .`, `restore .`), imported rather than copied, so the two
      hooks cannot drift into disagreeing about what is destructive. The
      unwrapped payload is what is re-scanned, so the direct (unwrapped)
      spellings are untouched here and stay `git-guardrails.py`'s to decide —
      no double denial, no second opinion.
      LIMIT, disclosed: only the DENY LIST is shared. The dirty-tree check on
      merge/rebase/pull is NOT applied to wrapped payloads, so
      `bash -c 'git merge main'` on a dirty tree is still seen by neither hook.
      The override for the shared rules stays git-guardrails' own (run it in a
      terminal yourself), not this hook's ALLOW_ROOT_OF_TRUST_WRITE.

Allowed, deliberately:

    - every READ — cat, grep, ls, head, diff, shasum, and running a hook
      (`python3 .claude/hooks/<name>.py`).
    - Edit / Write / MultiEdit on the same files. Those arrive as a diff the
      user can read; a shell one-liner does not. This guard closes the
      silent path, it does not lock the files.

When a command is ambiguous the guard ALLOWS it. A false deny that makes
the repository unusable costs more than the narrow case it would have
caught, so every rule keys off a command that can only be writing.

WHAT THIS TRIPWIRE IS — best-effort defense-in-depth, NOT a proof, and NOT a
control that can stop a change. It is a textual scan, not a sandbox. Its single
claim is about CHANNEL: a shell one-liner that would have overwritten a gate
silently gets denied, so the change has to come back through Edit/Write, where
it lands as a diff. Whether anyone READS that diff is outside this file.

Be precise about what is not here. In the shipped configuration there may be no
protective control elsewhere at all:
  - the reviewable Edit/Write diff is RETROSPECTIVE VISIBILITY, not
    authorisation. It tells you afterwards; it stops nothing.
  - `bypassPermissions` being a deliberate operator posture is a fact about how
    the repo is configured. It is not a control.
  - a machine-wide guard in `~/.claude/hooks/` is OPTIONAL and lives outside
    this repository — present on the maintainer's machine, absent in a fresh
    fork unless the forker installs one.
A real control would have to sit OUTSIDE the worktree — the ordinary permission
system with a non-empty `deny` list, or a machine-level hook — and would have
to cover Edit/Write/MultiEdit and branch transitions too. If you want one, that
is where to put it; this file cannot be it.

`git-guardrails.py` is a sibling of the same kind and carries the same
limitation. Neither hook's audit trail RECOVERS anything: the transcript records
that a loss happened, and `git reflog`/`ORIG_HEAD` recover a moved COMMIT
POINTER — neither holds the bytes of an uncommitted edit, an untracked file, or
an ignored one. `git reset --hard` and `git clean -fdx` destroy exactly those.
Call these an audit trail and a commit-history recovery aid; do not call them a
backstop.

WHAT IT CATCHES: direct writes and deletes (redirection, tee, cp/mv/rm/ln,
sed -i, dd, find -delete, tar -x, and GIT'S OWN working-tree writers —
`git rm/checkout -- /restore/clean/stash push -- /mv`) whose protected-path
target appears as a literal argument, and the two known command-payload
carriers — a shell
`sh/bash/… -c '<payload>'` and `env -S/--split-string`/`-vS` — reached after
the known command wrappers (env/sudo/nice/stdbuf/timeout/…). Both carriers are
unwrapped and re-scanned (depth <= 2). A command formatted across several lines
with BACKSLASH-NEWLINE continuations is spliced before tokenising (r12), so the
multi-line spelling of a write is read as the one command bash will run — it
used to split into two segments and go silent. A protected path spelled with a
shell GLOB or a BRACE GROUP is caught since r15 (`rm -f .claude/hook?/…`,
`.claude/*/…`, `.clau*/hooks/…`, `settings.jso?`, `hook[s]`, `{hooks,rules}`,
`.githook?/…`): the token's BRACE GROUPS are expanded into their alternatives,
and then each path SEGMENT is compared against the protected names with
`fnmatch`. That test is LEXICAL — no `glob`, no `stat`, no filesystem call
anywhere in it (r13 doc fix; `glob` is not even imported) — so the verdict never
depends on what happens to exist when the hook runs, and a pattern that would
expand to nothing here is matched all the same. Before r15 every one of those
spellings was ALLOWED while its literal twin was denied — a one-character edit
flipped the verdict. The csh-style `>&<target>` redirection joined the caught
set at r18, for the same reason and with the same measurement: it is `&>` by
another name, it truncated `.claude/settings.json` in a throwaway fixture while
`&>`/`>`/`>|` all denied, and it was missing from BOTH redirection surfaces —
the tokenizer split it into `>` plus the SEPARATOR `&`, and the backstop's
target class excludes `&`. Descriptor duplication (`>&2`, `1>&2`, `2>&1`, `>&-`)
is excluded from it and stays allowed. ORDINARY QUOTING PLACED INSIDE THE
PROTECTED NAME joined the caught set at r20 — `.clau\de/…`, `.cl'aud'e/…`,
`.cl"aud"e/…`, `.githook\s/…`, and the same split across a line continuation.
The scan half always read these correctly; what silenced them was the literal
substring test in front of it, for the third time (`_may_name_a_protected_path`
has the measurements). The trigger is now taken on the line with `\`, `'` and
`"` deleted as well as as written — those three are the whole set of QUOTING
characters that can sit inside a word without changing which file it names (a
variable or a substitution can too, and both are disclosed as residual below) —
and the
continuation splice was corrected to DELETE the backslash-newline the way the
shell does rather than substitute a space for it.

WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH — disclosed residual, in scope for a future audit as
BOUNDARY, not as a defect:
  - a write performed by an INTERPRETER whose program text this scan cannot
    read into — `python3 -c '...open(path,"w")...'`, `perl -e`, `node -e`,
    `ruby -e`, an `awk` program. These are execution forms, not command lines
    the tokenizer can see a literal path in.
  - a protected path fed to a deleter through a PIPE — `... | xargs rm`,
    `... | xargs -0 truncate` — where the path never appears as a literal
    argument on a command line this scanner sees.
  - a protected path produced by a COMMAND SUBSTITUTION rather than written as
    a literal — `echo X > $(echo .claude/settings.json)`, and the same write
    spelled with backticks, both measured ALLOWED (silent) on 2026-08-24 in a
    throwaway project fixture while the literal spelling DENIED. The
    substitution's OUTPUT is the path, and this scan reads command TEXT, so the
    token it sees is `$(echo` — a word naming nothing protected. Neither the
    tokenizer path nor the `_REDIR` backstop has a literal to test. This is
    disclosed rather than
    half-built: recursing into a substitution would mean predicting what an
    arbitrary command prints, which is the shell simulation `git-guardrails.py`
    tore out at r8 for making the guard's own complexity the leak. The sibling
    hook already discloses the same class for its history ops.
  - a VARIABLE OR SUBSTITUTION SITTING INSIDE A PROTECTED SEGMENT'S NAME, which
    is a NARROWER residual than `in_project`'s docstring may suggest and is
    disclosed here so the two are not confused. That function says an
    unresolvable token "fails toward DENYING", and it does — for the SCOPE half,
    which is the only half it speaks for. Measured 2026-08-24 in a throwaway
    project fixture: `rm -f $UNSET/.claude/hooks/…` DENIES, exactly as that
    sentence implies, because the segment `.claude` is still there to match.
    But `rm -f .clau${NOPE}de/hooks/…` and `rm -f .clau$(echo d)e/hooks/…` are
    both ALLOWED (silent), because the PATTERN half never sees a protected name
    at all — bash expands `.clau${NOPE}de` to `.claude` (an unset variable
    expands to nothing), while this scan reads the token as written. Position,
    not presence, decides: a variable BEFORE the protected segment leaves the
    segment intact and is caught; one INSIDE it destroys the only thing the
    pattern half matches on. Closing it means expanding variables and running
    substitutions — the shell simulation this pair deliberately refuses.
  - a git write whose target is NOT a literal path operand — `git apply <patch>`
    (the paths live inside the patch), `git reset --hard`, `git merge`,
    `git checkout <branch>` with no pathspec. These rewrite the tree from
    recorded state rather than from a path on this command line, so this scan
    has no literal to test. For the DIRECT spellings `git-guardrails.py` is the
    layer that governs them; for the spellings hidden in a shell/`env -S`
    payload — which git-guardrails treats as one opaque word — the cross-hook
    rule above hands the unwrapped payload to its deny list, and that covers
    the deny list ONLY. Still governed by NEITHER hook, in any spelling: `git
    apply`, and a branch-switching `git checkout`/`git switch` with no
    pathspec — the second is one of the four ways, listed at the top, that the
    gate files get replaced without this hook seeing anything.
  - a write ROUTED THROUGH A SYMLINK whose own name is not protected. The
    pattern half is purely lexical — `_spellings()` walks the token as written
    and the token its `..` segments resolve to LEXICALLY, and neither is the
    path the kernel lands on — so a link named anything else that points at a
    gate-defining directory is invisible to it. Measured 2026-08-24 in a
    throwaway project fixture, with `linkhooks -> .claude/hooks` and
    `linkdot -> .claude`: `rm -f linkhooks/git-guardrails.py`,
    `rm -f linkdot/hooks/git-guardrails.py`, `rm -f .claude/linkin/…` (the link
    inside `.claude` itself) and `echo X > linkdot/settings.json` were all
    ALLOWED (silent), while the literal twin `rm -f .claude/hooks/…` DENIED.
    Only the SCOPE half (`in_project`) resolves anything on disk, and it decides
    which tree a path is in, never whether it is protected. Recorded here as an
    uncovered class at r19; nothing in this file closes it, and the r16 `..`
    walk deliberately does not try to (resolving in place would LOSE denials
    that stand today — see the block above `resolve_parents`).
  - a `cd` EARLIER IN THE SAME COMMAND LINE. Relative tokens resolve against
    the tool call's cwd, not against a `cd` inside the command, so
    `cd /tmp/fixture && printf '{}' > .claude/settings.json` is scored against
    the project — it is DENIED though it writes elsewhere. That is the
    conservative direction (a false deny, remedied by using the absolute path),
    and it is the same residual `git-guardrails.py` discloses for `cd`.
  - a path built from a variable this process cannot expand (`$FIXTURE/.claude/
    settings.json` with FIXTURE unset in the hook's environment). It stays
    relative, resolves against the project, and is denied — again failing
    toward the deny.
  - an UNKNOWN wrapper or execution form not in the WRAPPERS/SHELLS tables, or
    an unlisted wrapper option that takes a SEPARATE value (assumed here to
    attach its value, which skips too LITTLE — a real command word is still
    scanned — rather than too much, so it fails toward catching the write).
    A CASE-VARIED spelling of a LISTED wrapper counts as unknown here: r19
    folded the WRITER-program names and the protected path segments, not the
    scaffolding in front of them. Measured 2026-08-24 on a throwaway project
    fixture, `nice rm -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py` DENIED while
    `NICE rm -f …` and `BASH -c 'rm -f …'` were ALLOWED (silent).
  - a GLOB whose expansion depends on a shell OPTION this scan does not model
    (r15, the residual left by the glob fix). A bare wildcard segment does not
    match a DOT-name because of an EXPLICIT rule in `_segment_matches` — a
    segment carrying no literal character of its own (`*`, `?`, `[a-z]*`) is
    refused against `.claude`/`.githooks` — not because of any `glob` module
    semantic, since nothing here expands anything. That rule mirrors bash
    WITHOUT `dotglob`, so with `dotglob` actually set `rm -rf *` really would
    take `.claude` with it and is allowed here; and the rule is load-bearing —
    delete it as "redundant" and every `rm -f build/*` starts being denied.
    `extglob` forms (`@(a|b)`, `!(x)`, `+(…)`) are not modelled either. What
    the fix does close is the ordinary case: a glob whose literal characters
    already name a protected segment is denied whether or not anything matching
    it exists. (Expanding for REAL — `glob.glob` against the event's cwd — was
    implemented first and DROPPED: it made the verdict depend on what happened
    to exist at hook time, could not see the not-yet-created
    `> .claude/settings.jso?` case, added filesystem work to every command
    carrying a `*`, and handed a pathological pattern like `/*/*/*/*` a way to
    stall the hook. The inline note above `_segment_matches` keeps the full
    reasoning. The cwd residual is real but belongs to PATH RESOLUTION, not to
    globbing — it is the `cd` bullet above.)
  - ANY SPELLING THAT PUTS A PROTECTED PATH SOMEWHERE THIS SCAN DOES NOT LOOK.
    The bullets above are the set known on 2026-08-24. They record where this
    scanner has been PROBED; they do not establish where it is complete, and
    reading the list as a closed enumeration is the mistake. Six consecutive
    rounds each turned up a spelling every earlier round had missed — globs
    (r15), `..` segments (r16), a shell COMMENT naming a heredoc (r17), `>&`
    (r18), the `$'…'` openers and case (r19), quoting inside the protected NAME
    itself (r20) — and every one of them
    failed toward ALLOW while its literal twin denied. Those are closed; the
    CLASS is not. Assume there are more, and that the next one also looks
    ordinary.
These are not closed, and nothing here closes them. The honest statement is that
they are UNCOVERED: the Edit/Write channel makes some of them visible after the
fact, which is not the same as covering them.

Decision protocol (modern PreToolUse): exit 0 + JSON
  {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}.
Fail-open: any error — malformed event, unparseable command, an exception
in this file — exits 0 with no decision (allow). A guard that hard-fails on
its own bug takes the session down with it; failing open loses coverage for
that one call, which is the cheaper failure for a best-effort deny.

Escape hatch: set ALLOW_ROOT_OF_TRUST_WRITE=1 in the ENVIRONMENT OF THE
SESSION (`ALLOW_ROOT_OF_TRUST_WRITE=1 claude`, or export it in the shell
that launches Claude Code). Prefixing the blocked Bash command with it does
not work and is not meant to: hooks run as separate processes, so the hatch
has to be a deliberate act of the person starting the session.

# below then read the segments AS WRITTEN. So an ordinary relative path that
# climbs back into a protected directory through an UNPROTECTED sibling was not
# recognised, while the shell resolved it to exactly the gate-defining file.
# Measured at 7b8848d, event cwd = the project, guard verdict vs. what the
# shell really does:
#
#     rm -f .claude/rules/../hooks/git-guardrails.py   SILENT -> file deleted
#     echo x > .claude/rules/../settings.json          SILENT -> file rewritten
#     rm -f .claude/agents/../settings.local.json      SILENT
#
# while the literal twins of all three DENIED. `..` was on NEITHER disclosed-
# residual list, and like the r15 glob class it failed toward ALLOW. Any real
# unprotected child of `.claude/` works as the pivot (rules, agents, skills,
# references, state); `.claude/../.claude/hooks/x` already denied, because
# there a second protected segment survives literally.
#
# RESOLUTION IS PURELY LEXICAL — no filesystem call, by the same choice the
# glob comment above records: the verdict must not depend on what happens to
# exist at hook time, and `> .claude/rules/../settings.jso?` names a file that
# need not exist yet. `in_project()` is the one half that touches disk, and it
# already realpaths the token, so the SCOPE half needs no change.
#
# BOTH SPELLINGS ARE TESTED, the token as written and the token `..` resolves
# it to (`_spellings`). Resolving in place would be strictly weaker: lexical
# and kernel resolution DIVERGE when a segment is a symlink (the kernel's `..`
# is the physical parent of the link TARGET), so a token that literally names
# `.claude/hooks` must keep being judged as naming it. The union can only add

# Until r15 the segment test below was a LITERAL string comparison, so one
# ordinary metacharacter took a protected path out of the guard's sight while
# the shell expanded it to exactly the protected file. Measured at 7eee6b2,
# event cwd = the project, guard verdict vs. what the shell expands to:
#
#     rm -f .claude/hook?/git-guardrails.py   ALLOW -> .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py
#     rm -f .claude/*/git-guardrails.py       ALLOW -> .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py
#     rm -f .clau*/hooks/git-guardrails.py    ALLOW -> .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py
#     echo x > .claude/settings.jso?          ALLOW -> .claude/settings.json
#     rm -rf .claude/hook[s]                  ALLOW
#     rm -f .claude/{hooks,rules}/…           ALLOW -> .claude/hooks/…
#     rm -f .githook?/pre-commit              ALLOW -> .githooks/pre-commit
#
# while the literal spellings of all three targets DENIED. Globbing was on
# NEITHER disclosed-residual list, and unlike every item that is on them it
# failed toward ALLOW. Tab completion and shorthand globs are how people spell
# paths; this was ordinary usage, not an evasion.
#
# THE TEST IS TEXTUAL, not a real expansion, and that is a choice: a segment
# matches a protected NAME when `fnmatch` says the shell's expansion could
# produce it. Expanding for real (`glob.glob` against the event cwd) was tried
# first and buys nothing this does not — see the dotfile rule below — while it
# would make the verdict depend on what happens to exist at hook time, add
# filesystem work to every command carrying a `*`, and hand a pathological
# pattern (`/*/*/*/*`) a way to stall the hook. Text also covers the file that
# does not exist YET, which is exactly the `> .claude/settings.jso?` case.
#
# THE DOTFILE RULE is what keeps this from denying everything. A bare wildcard
# segment (`*`, `?`, `[a-z]*` — no literal character of its own) fnmatches
# every name, so without a rule `rm -f build/*` would be DENIED. It must not
# be: bash without `dotglob`, and Python's glob likewise, never expand a bare
# wildcard to a DOTFILE, so `*` cannot become `.claude` or `.githooks`. So a
# segment must carry a literal character to match a DOT-name, while against
# the ordinary names under `.claude/` (`hooks`, `settings.json`,
# `settings.local.json`) a bare wildcard matches — because there it really
# does expand: `rm -rf .claude/*` deletes the hooks. `dotglob` being set is

# A backslash-newline is a LINE CONTINUATION in POSIX shell: it JOINS the line,
# it does not end the command. `_TOKEN` lists `\n` in its separator alternation
# while its word alternation's escape class (`\\.`) cannot match backslash +
# newline — `.` excludes newline outside DOTALL — so a trailing `\` was consumed
# as an ordinary word character and the newline behind it ENDED the segment.
# Executed against the pre-fix guard (r11): `rm -f \` + newline +
# `    .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py` emitted no decision, and the same string
# through `bash -c` really deleted the guard file, while the byte-equivalent
# one-line spelling DENIED. Protection depended on where the author had put a
# newline — ordinary multi-line formatting, not an evasion. So the continuation
# is spliced the way the shell splices it, BEFORE anything is tokenised.
#
# The RUN of backslashes is what decides. `\\` is an ESCAPED backslash, so
# `\\` + newline is a literal backslash followed by a REAL separator, not a
# continuation. The even-run prefix is consumed first and re-emitted, so only an
# ODD trailing backslash joins; a naive `\\\n -> " "` substitution would splice
# the NEXT command onto this one and could false-deny. A newline with no
# backslash in front of it is untouched and still separates commands, and a
# backslash NOT followed by a newline (a literal `\` inside a quoted string) is
# never matched at all.
#
# r20 — THE SPLICE INSERTED A SPACE, AND THE SHELL DOES NOT. POSIX is explicit:
# "the <backslash> and <newline> shall be removed before splitting the input
# into tokens" — REMOVED, not replaced. The r11 repair substituted `" "`, which
# is indistinguishable from removal at a token BOUNDARY (its own measured case
# had whitespace on both sides) and wrong INSIDE a word: it split one word bash
# keeps whole, so the halves were scored separately and matched nothing.
# Measured 2026-08-24 at 727a66c, event cwd = the project:
#
#     rm -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py    DENY   (literal control)
#     rm -f .clau\ + newline + de/hooks/…      ALLOW (silent)
#
# while `printf '%s\n'` on the same string prints ONE word,
# `.claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py`. Same class as the fast-path defect above —
# a backslash inside the protected directory name — and the same failure
# direction, so it is closed with it rather than disclosed. The substitution

# THE OPENER SCAN IS QUOTE-AWARE AND HERESTRING-AWARE (r16). It used to be one
# quote-blind regex — `<<-?\s*(['"]?)([A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*)\1` — run over RAW
# line text with `finditer`. Two ordinary spellings therefore opened a heredoc
# that bash never opens, and every line after them (to the end of the command,
# or to a line spelling the invented terminator) was DELETED before anything was
# tokenised:
#
#   * a HERESTRING. To that regex `tr a-z A-Z <<< hello` is `<<` + `\s*` +
#     `hello`, so `hello` became the terminator.
#   * a `<<WORD` inside a QUOTED STRING. `echo '<<EOF'` and
#     `echo "docs: use <<EOF"` are prose bash merely prints; both opened one.
#
# Measured at 7b8848d against throwaway fixture trees, line 2 of a two-line
# command carrying the real op: after `tr a-z A-Z <<< hello` this guard went
# SILENT on `rm -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py` and on
# `echo x > .claude/settings.json`, and the sibling hook went SILENT on
# `git reset --hard HEAD~1`, `git clean -fd`, `git push --force origin main`,
# `git add -A` and a dirty-tree `git merge` — every one of which DENIES when
# line 1 is `echo hi`, and bash runs line 2 in all of them. Dropping REAL
# command text is a missed deny, the one direction a guard must not fail in,
# and this took the whole deny spine of both hooks with it.
#
# So the line is WALKED, not pattern-matched: quote state is tracked (and
# carried ACROSS lines, because a shell string may span them), `<<<` is consumed
# whole so it can never be read as a `<<`, and a delimiter is taken only from an
# opener found OUTSIDE quotes. An UNBALANCED quote leaves the rest of the
# command in quote state, so no opener is found and NO text is dropped — that
# fails toward scanning more, which is the safe direction here.
#
# r17 — THE WALK IS ALSO COMMENT-AWARE, and the r16 fix above is what made that
# necessary: it modelled quoting and herestrings but gave the scan NO notion of
# a shell COMMENT, while `strip_heredocs` runs BEFORE the comment-aware
# segmenting the sibling hook performs on the same text. So an ORDINARY `#`
# comment that merely NAMES a heredoc opened one, and every following line was
# DELETED before anything was tokenised. This class was INTRODUCED by r16: its
# disclosed residual named exactly one surviving opener misread (the arithmetic
# shift below), and this was a second one, one character away from the quoted
# spelling r16 had just closed.
#
# Measured 2026-08-23 against throwaway fixtures (a project fixture holding
# `.claude/hooks/` and `.claude/settings.json`; a git fixture with one modified
# tracked file), line 2 carrying the real op. With line 1 =
# `# heredoc <<EOF` this guard went SILENT on
# `rm -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py` and on a redirect into
# `.claude/settings.json`, and the sibling hook went SILENT on
# `git reset --hard HEAD~1`, a destructive `clean -fdx`, a force push,
# `git add -A` and a dirty-tree `git merge main`. With line 1 = an ordinary
# comment carrying no `<<`, every one of them DENIED. Executed, not simulated:
# `bash -c` on the two-line form left the guard file absent, so bash runs line 2
# while the hook writes nothing — and a hook that writes nothing is what an
# allow looks like.
#
# THE RULE: an unquoted `#` that BEGINS a word — start of line, or preceded by
# whitespace or one of `;&|()` — ends the line for opener purposes. That is the
# same test the sibling's `_segments` applies to raw words, so the two parsers
# stop disagreeing about what a comment is; the separator set here is
# deliberately a SUPERSET of that tokenizer's, because erring toward "this is a
# comment" makes the scan stop EARLIER, find FEWER openers and drop LESS text —
# the safe direction, the same one the quote handling already fails toward. A
# `#` inside quotes is untouched (`echo '#'` still opens nothing), a `#` in
# mid-word is not a comment (`git log --format=%h#%s <<EOF` still opens one),
# and an unbalanced quote still drops NOTHING.
#
# Disclosed residual, unchanged by either fix: a `<<` in an arithmetic left-shift
# whose right operand is an identifier (`$(( x << n ))`) still reads as an
# opener and still drops the lines after it. Requiring the `<<` to sit in
# redirection position would close it and would also stop recognising the
# equally ordinary `cat<<EOF`, so it is disclosed rather than guessed at.

# --- cross-hook: destructive git inside an unwrapped payload ---------------

# and the division left a hole neither owned:
#
#   * this hook unwraps a shell `-c` / `env -S` payload, but every rule it then
#     applies keys off a PROTECTED LITERAL PATH. `git reset --hard` names none,
#     so the unwrapped payload was re-scanned and found nothing;
#   * `git-guardrails.py` owns the destructive-git deny list, but it does not
#     unwrap payload carriers — to it, `bash -c '<payload>'` is one word whose
#     basename is `bash`, so no `git` invocation is found at all.
#
# Result: `bash -c 'git reset --hard'` and `bash -c 'git clean -fdx'` were
# denied by NEITHER, while their bare spellings were denied by git-guardrails.
# The second deletes untracked and ignored files, which is research data that no
# reflog holds. These are ordinary execution forms — a wrapper is how a script,
# a `Makefile`, or a generated command line spells things — not evasion attempts,
# so "a determined caller was never the threat model" does not excuse it.
#
# The fix is the one the referee asked for and the one that cannot drift: the
# payload-unwrapping layer CALLS the shared rules rather than reimplementing
# them. `git_deny_reason()` is IMPORTED from the sibling hook, so there is one
# definition of "destructive git" in the repository. A copy here would be a
# second consumer of an unwritten table, which is exactly the shape that
# produced git-guardrails' own r9/r10 defects.
#
# SCOPE, deliberately narrow:
#   * only the DENY LIST is shared, not the dirty-tree check. That check needs
#     the event dict, a resolved repository, and a live `git status`; wiring it
#     through a second hook would duplicate repository-identity logic — the
#     precise thing that keeps going wrong. Disclosed in the docstring instead.
#   * only UNWRAPPED payloads are tested. A direct `git reset --hard` reaches
#     this hook too, but git-guardrails already denies it; testing it here as
#     well would produce two denials for one command and make each hook's
#     battery depend on the other's behaviour.
#   * fail-open on anything the sibling RAISES — including a `SystemExit`. The
#     sibling is exec'd IN THIS PROCESS, so a `sys.exit()` reached while its
#     module body runs is not the sibling's problem, it is this hook's death:
#     the process ends with status 0 and an EMPTY stdout, and an empty stdout is
#     exactly what an ALLOW looks like. Both foreign-code entry points
#     (`exec_module`, and the `git_deny_reason` call) therefore catch
#     `BaseException`, not `Exception`. What is NOT survivable is named in
#     `_git_guardrails`'s docstring; the honest boundary is "raises", not "any
#     failure".

    pairs with its own sibling rather than the repository's. The module is
    import-safe as shipped: it does all its work under `if __name__ ==
    "__main__"`.

    SURVIVABLE — returns None, the caller gets no cross-hook opinion, and this
    hook's own path rules run exactly as they did before the sibling existed:
    the file missing, unreadable, or not loadable as a module; and ANYTHING the
    sibling's module body RAISES. That last word is the r20 correction. The
    sentence here used to read "Returns None on any failure", and the block
    above promised "fail-open on anything", while the code caught `Exception` —
    which is not `BaseException`. Because the sibling is exec'd IN THIS PROCESS,
    a `SystemExit` raised at its import time terminated root-of-trust-guard.py
    itself with status 0 and an EMPTY stdout, and empty stdout is
    indistinguishable from an allow. Measured 2026-08-24 at 727a66c: with
    `.claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py` replaced by `import sys; sys.exit(0)`, a
    write into `.claude/hooks/` returned rc=0 and said nothing — a SILENT ALLOW
    of a gate-file write. Not hypothetical either: an audit agent hit it by
    accident while building a stub and read the spurious result as a finding.
    `BaseException` is caught now, so `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt` and
    every ordinary exception all land in the same place.

    NOT SURVIVABLE, and no `except` clause can make it so: anything that ends
    the PROCESS without raising in this thread — `os._exit()`, a fatal signal, a
    crash inside a C extension the sibling imports — or a sibling whose module
    body never returns, since the harness then kills the hook on its registered
    timeout. In every one of those this file dies with nothing on stdout, which
    the harness reads as an allow. The mitigation is not here: it is that the

    r15 — THE SAME LITERAL-COMPARISON DEFECT, ONE LEVEL UP. This used to be
    `".claude" not in cmd and ".githooks" not in cmd → return 0`, which is a
    LITERAL substring test standing in front of the whole scan. Fixing
    `matches_root_of_trust` to read globs was therefore not enough on its own:
    `rm -f .clau*/hooks/git-guardrails.py` and `rm -f .githook?/pre-commit`
    still returned before anything looked at them, because the metacharacter
    sits inside the protected DIRECTORY name and neither literal appears.
    Measured: both went SILENT with the pattern half already fixed.

    So the trigger is widened to "or the line carries a glob/brace
    metacharacter", which fails toward SCANNING. The cost is that a command
    containing a `*` is now tokenised and scored; that is pure string work
    (the pattern half touches no filesystem, and `in_project` runs only once a
    pattern has matched), and it is the same work the scan already did for
    every command mentioning `.claude`.

    r19 — THE SAME DEFECT AGAIN, TWICE, AND FOR THE SAME REASON: this literal
    test stands in front of the whole scan, so a fix below it is dead code for
    any command line the test rejects.

      * CASE. The substring test was case-SENSITIVE while the filesystem this
        repository lives on is not (APFS). With `_segment_matches` already
        folded, `echo X > .CLAUDE/settings.json` STILL returned here before
        anything looked at it — measured 2026-08-24 on a throwaway project
        fixture, ALLOW (silent), while the lowercase twin DENIED. The line is
        folded before the test now.
      * ANSI-C QUOTING. `$'\\x2eclaude/settings.json'` names the protected file
        to bash and carries none of its literal characters, so neither substring
        appears. A line carrying a `$'` or `$"` opener therefore always goes
        through to the scan, where `unquote` decodes it.

    r20 — THE THIRD DEFECT FROM THIS ONE FAST PATH, AND THE LAST ONE THAT WILL
    BE PATCHED AS AN INSTANCE. Ordinary shell quoting placed INSIDE the
    protected directory NAME carries neither literal, no glob metacharacter and
    no `$` opener, so the line was rejected here and the scan — which unquotes
    every word at every nesting depth, and would have denied all six — never
    ran. Measured 2026-08-24 at 727a66c on a throwaway project fixture, guard
    verdict then what bash actually did:

        rm -f .claude/hooks/git-guardrails.py      DENY   (literal control)
        rm -f .clau\\de/hooks/git-guardrails.py     ALLOW (silent) -> file DELETED
        echo X > .clau\\de/settings.json            ALLOW (silent)
        rm -f .githook\\s/pre-commit                ALLOW (silent)
        rm -f .cl'aud'e/hooks/git-guardrails.py   ALLOW (silent) -> file DELETED
        rm -f .cl"aud"e/hooks/git-guardrails.py   ALLOW (silent)

    WHY THIS CLOSES THE CLASS RATHER THAN THREE MORE INSTANCES. The trigger is
    now computed on `_denoise(cmd)` as WELL as on the raw line: a copy with
    bash's quote characters deleted. `\\`, `'` and `"` are the COMPLETE set of
    characters that can sit inside a word without changing which file the word
    names — every remaining quoting form is one of them with a `$` in front,
    and that `$` has its own test here since r19. Deleting all three therefore
    collapses EVERY arrangement of them, in any quantity, in any order, at any
    nesting depth, back to the literal the shell will use; there is no fourth
    spelling to enumerate later because there is no fourth character. That is
    the difference between this and the r15/r19 repairs, which each taught the
    trigger one more thing to look for.

    THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE SAME CLASS, found by probing this repair rather
    than reported: a LINE CONTINUATION inside the name (`.clau\\` + newline +
    `de/hooks/…`). The backslash is quoting noise like any other, but the
    newline behind it is not, so deletion alone leaves `.clau\\nde`. It is the
    SPLICE that has to be right, and it was not — see the r20 note above
    `join_continuations`, which used to substitute a space where the shell
    deletes. With the splicer corrected the trigger simply runs on the spliced
    line, and the scan (which splices too) agrees with it.

    Each widening fails toward SCANNING, and that direction is what makes them
    safe: this function decides only whether to LOOK. A false trigger costs one
    tokenisation of a string that the scan will then clear (`echo ".clau"`
    denoises to `echo .clau`, matches nothing, allowed); it cannot produce a
    false deny, because the deny is the scan's verdict on the real words."""
    # r21: SPLICE FIRST, THEN TEST EVERY TRIGGER ON THE SPLICED TEXT. The r20
    # fix taught only the FIRST branch to read the spliced line and left the
    # other two reading the raw one, which composed the two widenings in one
    # direction only. A `$` separated from its quote by a backslash-newline
    # therefore carried no `$'` substring for branch two, and its ANSI-C escape
    # (`\x2e`) hid the dot from branch one, so the scan was never entered.
    # Measured at 0d16939 on a throwaway project fixture: an `rm -f` whose
